Serialization
Java 8 lambda
java memory model
Heap data structure
which sorting technique is used in collections sorting
rest principles and interview questions
memcached
some of the load balancing techniques

F2F

1)Find out the duplicate words in a file containing a paragraph. (Used hashing)
But interview wants me to try it out with trie DS.
2)Find out the longest repeating subsequence in a given string (Dynamic Programming)
3)Print the boundary nodes of a Binary Tree. (Left View + Right view +Bottom View)  
4)Write a program to parse protocol and domain name given a URL string.
3) LRU cache


Impelement rank based cached, least rank should be evicted, rank is exposed by data object itself.,  use min heap or priority queue

wallmart
1. Design searching system or booking system or google kind of things
2. Data structures and algorithms

Need to design a system to collect all the logs based on type, like 202, 404 from different nodes and show them in front end
