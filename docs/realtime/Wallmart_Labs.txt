1. REST service principles
2. How to design a servive to get that deployed to cloud, or may be micro service architecuture
3. REST to update details of a person has called and updated by mistake, how do we correct it a fraction of time in distributed system.
4. Overall time SLA for an API rest call is 5 ms, one of the internal api takes 3 ms and other one 3.5 ms. How do we design this
5. Thread pool implementation
6. How to analyze performance issues or blocking sessions in oracle

Round 2

1. Design architecture of micro services
   or how to design an application such that it can be deployed to cloud
2. Represent a mobile phone as Object
3. given two arrays of same size, print the sum to third array that each time each invidual sum index should be different and there should not be any pattern as such
4. SOAP vs REST

Round 3

1. Allocation (memory ) for applications, how to decide min memory allocate for an application if no other application is running on that host
   How to get more memory if in run time it requires more memory but still within the range of max memory allocated to that application
2. How to bench mark API
3. GC in depth, why major GC taking more time
4. Difference between concurrent and parallel
5. different tools to analyze memory utilization and gc
6. JIT
7. db shards, consistent hashing
